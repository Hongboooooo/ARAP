# ARAP
As rigid as possible deformation, a fundamental regularizer for non-rigid visual tasks 
>Red faces form fixed set and Green faces form handle set\n
>We use ARAP to obtain a physically plausible and smooth deformation\n 
>This work demonstrates the equivalence of linear and Newton solver(second order) for non-rigid deformation tasks.
